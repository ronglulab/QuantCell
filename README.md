# QuantCell

# Introduction
QuantCell is a machine learning based framework designed to enhance cell annotation in spatial omics data by integrating both qualitative and quantitative imaging profiles. It addresses significant challenges in analyzing complex tissues, such as those with limited molecular markers, overlapping marker expression, or rare cell types.

# Installation Guide
## Prerequisites for QuantCell
* Python 3.11.0
* NumPy 1.26.0
* pandas 1.5.3
* scikit-learn 1.5.0
* Matplotlib 3.7.1
* glob2 0.7
* Joblib 1.4.2
* tqdm 4.6.5

## Prerequisites for Replicating Paper Figures
* All of the prerequisites mentioned above
* SciPy 1.11.0
* seaborn 0.13.2
* pyyaml 6.0
* astir 0.1.2
* MAPS 1.0.0
* AnnoSpat 1.0.0

*QuantCell was tested using a Python environment with the prerequisite packages above on a dedicated server with Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. There are no other hardware or software dependencies but the authors make no guarantee it will work on every system.

To install the required packages, you can use pip:

```
pip install numpy==1.26.0 pandas==1.5.3 scikit-learn==1.5.0 matplotlib==3.7.1 glob2==0.7 joblib==1.4.2 tqdm==4.6.5
pip install scipy==1.11.0 seaborn==0.13.2 pyyaml==6.0 astir==0.1.2 MAPS==1.0.0 AnnoSpat==1.0.0
```
